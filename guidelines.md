# Creating Stats Comics

Stats comics aim to provide easy access to
* hypotheses, conditions and decisions involved in a study
* the setup, steps, and proceedure, 
* the results

To that end, stats comics draw inspiration from traditional comics such as
* a combination of __text + picture__, i.e., any picture can be accompanied by text to explain additional information about the picture or provide information to resolve ambiguity in the picture. 
* a __sequence of panels__, whereby each panel can focus on a single message, i.e., a single piece of information while the sequence helps explaining more complex information

Especially for stats comcis, that means that __you can__
* illustrate in pictures what requires visual explanation, 
* explain in the text, what is hard to convey through pictures
* mix data visualizations (e.g., charts) with schematic representations (e.g., flow-charts), and other illustrations (e.g., study setup)
* annotate figures, especially information about your data visualizations
* be consistent with your visual choices, e.g., reuse colors and charts as much as possible througout the comic.
* sometimes a single panel is enough, sometimes you may decide on several panels. 
* some panels might be large and contain a lot of infomation, sometimes a panel might be fairly small with a picture only.

# Purpose of this stats comics workshop

The purpose of this workshop is 
* __For you:__ to help you create compelling stats comics for your study to be included in your website, a poster, or even a paper.
* __For us:__ to understand which concepts you need to illustrate, which visual solutions you prefer, and how we can help you creating your stats comics. This will help us creating more complete guidelines for stats comics in HCI.

The workshop is structured as follows: 
1. We __introduce stats comics__, including an [example](examples.html),
2. explain the __background of our research__, 
3. __you prepre a storyboard__---i.e., a rough outline---for your own stats comic, using the below [stages and guidelines](#stats-comics-stages). That stoyboard, should contain information about 
  * what to show and in which order
  * textual annotations
  * visual explanations to explain your study 
4. Once you are happy with your storyboard, you contact us and we __will go with you through your storyboard to discuss any  difficulties you found__. Together, we will try to find solutions to any issues. 
5. __We return you a draft for a polished version__, designed by one of our graphic designers/illustators
6. __you provide feedback__ for a last polishing.
  
More information about the study and is ethics procedure can be [found here](workshop.html). For any question, please contact [Zezhong Wang](mailto:zezhong.wang@ed.ac.uk).

# Stats comics stages

This section guides you through creating a stats comic for your own study. 

Keep in mind the following:
* __you may not need to illustrate each stage in your study__. The below list is extensive to capture as many parts of a study as possible. You chose the stages that are most important and can benefit you study most.
* the list gives examples of what to report. __The list may be incomplete__ and we are interested in which stages and informtion _your_ study requires to show.

_We do not give visual examples to not bias your decisions. We are interested which visual solutions you find to report your study. __There is no right or wrong__ as we want to __work and discuss with you__ to the find the best possible representation for your study._ 

## Part I: Setup & Proceedure 

* [1. Context and Motivation](#context-and-motivation) 
* [2. Conditions](#conditions) 
* _to be completed..._

### 1. Context and Motivation
The objective of this stage is to introduce the context and problem to your audience and provide background knowledge for the audience to understand your research. This includes
* The problem you're studying
* the domain
* important terms and concepts, and 
* Any other background information you consider necessary

The context might be best introduced with conventional and schematic drawings, rather than data visualiztions.

### 2. Conditions
Explain the conditions you are testing in your study. 
This should include 
* any baseline technique(s), 
* features to be evaluated, 
* materials or devices involved in the study. 

Similar to Context and Motivation, conditions could be illustrated with conventional drawings such as schematic representations.

### 3. Hypotheses
Explain the hypotheses of your study. For predicting effect sizes and quantitative results, for example, you could use data visualizations as you would use to report your results. It is important to highlight any difference or values you predict in your hypotheses. You may decide to place the hypotheses before the condition if that works better.

### 4. Tasks
Tasks are designed activities for participants in the study to measure the performance with different conditions. Illustrating tasks may include
* What do participants see or work with during each task? 
* What do participants have to do in each task, e.g., interactions or other actions?
* Which steps are they going through? 

### 5. Data Samples & study materials
Data samples are selected or generated examples to be used in the study. The samples should reflect 
* representative examples of samples, 
* parameters and factors that influenced the eventual generation of samples (e.g., size, difficulty, ..)  
* generation methods, if appropriate. 

### 6. Power Analysis
Power can be calculated and reported for an experiment to comment on the confidence one might have in the conclusions drawn from the results of the study.  It can be used as a tool to estimate the number of observations or sample size required in order to detect an effect in an experiment.  

### 7. Study Setup
The study setup gives an overview of the study process and logic. It can include 
* an explanation of the study environment (e.g., in lab, in-the-wild, crowd-sourced, specific devices, interviews, ...); 
* participants and specific selection criteria
* the sequence of steps involved in the setup (e.g., instructions, training, repetitions, questionnaires, ...)
* important information about each state (e.g., length of each stage,); sample and task assignment (e.g., by randomization plot). 


### 8. Dependent variables and data collection
This stage should report
* What data has been collected (e.g., error, task-completion time, subjective feedback, counting mouse clicks, eye-tracking...)
* how data has been collected or calculated (e.g., which stages of the study were timed, how was task-accuracy calculated, how was eye-tracking analyzed, how were interview replied coded, ... )

## Part II: Result Analysis

### 9. Data Transformations and Checks
This stage presents the transformations and checks for the data, performed before the result analysis and any significant tests or regressions. This stage includes explaining
* data transformations (e.g., log-transform, ...)
* outlier removals and winsorizing
* checking for normal distributions

### 10. Results Presentation
The result presentation is an essential stage of the entire report. Although it can be shown in different levels of detail, it may use one chart to summarize a result, while the visualization may require some explanation to highlight
* reordering bars to be compared side by side on a barchart
* show significant differences between conditions (e.g., which differences did you find, how strong were they, which differences were significant, ... )
* Show other findings such as trends, extreme values, distributions, showing outliers, 
* You can provide different views onto the same chart (e.g., provide overview and detail, or show the same chart twice with different annotations). Furthermore, it may discuss how results reflect different conditions by referring to the data samples.

### 11. Hypotheses proof
This stage presents the conclusion by contrasting hypotheses, as stated in the beginning, with the result of the study. You may show 
* How do your hypotheses compare with your results?
* which hypotheses can be accepted and which have to be rejected?
