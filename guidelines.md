# Guidelines for creating Stats Comics


## Setup & Proceedure 

__Context and Motivation__
The objective of this stage is to introduce the context and problem to your audience and provide background knowledge for the audience to understand your research. This includes
* The problem you're studying
* the domain
* important terms and concepts, and 
* Any other background information you consider necessary

The context might be best introduced with conventional and schematic drawings, rather than data visualiztions.

__Conditions__
Explain the conditions you are testing in your study. 
This should include 
* any baseline technique(s), 
* features to be evaluated, 
* materials or devices involved in the study. 

Similar to Context and Motivation, conditions could be illustrated with conventional drawings such as schematic representations.

__Hypotheses__
Explain the hypotheses of your study. For predicting effect sizes and quantitative results, for example, you could use data visualizations as you would use to report your results. It is important to highlight any difference or values you predict in your hypotheses.

__Tasks__
Tasks are designed activities for participants in the study to measure the performance with different conditions. Illustrating tasks may include
* What do participants see or work with during each task? 
* What do participants have to do in each task, e.g., interactions or other actions?
* Which steps are they going through? 

__Data Samples & study materials__
Data samples are selected or generated examples to be used in the study. The samples should reflect 
* representative examples of samples, 
* parameters and factors that influenced the eventual generation of samples (e.g., size, difficulty, ..)  
* generation methods, if appropriate. 

__Power Analysis__
Power can be calculated and reported for an experiment to comment on the confidence one might have in the conclusions drawn from the results of the study.  It can be used as a tool to estimate the number of observations or sample size required in order to detect an effect in an experiment.  

__Study Setup__
The study setup gives an overview of the study process and logic. It can include 
* an explanation of the study environment (e.g., in lab, in-the-wild, crowd-sourced, specific devices, interviews, ...); 
* participants and specific selection criteria
* the sequence of steps involved in the setup (e.g., instructions, training, repetitions, questionnaires, ...)
* important information about each state (e.g., length of each stage,); sample and task assignment (e.g., by randomization plot). 


__Dependent variables and data collection__
This stage should report
* What data has been collected (e.g., error, task-completion time, subjective feedback, counting mouse clicks, eye-tracking...)
* how data has been collected or calculated (e.g., which stages of the study were timed, how was task-accuracy calculated, how was eye-tracking analyzed, how were interview replied coded, ... )

## RESULT ANALYSIS 

__Data Transformations and Checks__
This stage presents the transformations and checks for the data, performed before the result analysis and any significant tests or regressions. This stage includes explaining
* data transformations (e.g., log-transform, ...)
* outlier removals and winsorizing
* checking for normal distributions

__Results Presentation__
The result presentation is an essential stage of the entire report. Although it can be shown in different levels of detail, it may use one chart to summarize a result, while the visualization may require some explanation to highlight
* reordering bars to be compared side by side on a barchart
* show significant differences between conditions (e.g., which differences did you find, how strong were they, which differences were significant, ... )
* Show other findings such as trends, extreme values, distributions, showing outliers, 
* You can provide different views onto the same chart (e.g., provide overview and detail, or show the same chart twice with different annotations). Furthermore, it may discuss how results reflect different conditions by referring to the data samples.


__Hypotheses proof__
This stage presents the conclusion by contrasting hypotheses, as stated in the beginning, with the result of the study. You may show 
* How do your hypotheses compare with your results?
* which hypotheses can be accepted and which have to be rejected?
